        <h3>🛶 Paddling Safety Tips</h3>
        <p><strong>Cold Water Warning:</strong> Glacial lakes are extremely cold (4-12°C even in summer). Wear a PFD at all times and don't venture far from shore unless experienced.</p>
        <p><strong>Weather Changes Fast:</strong> Mountain weather can shift quickly. Watch for afternoon winds and thunderstorms. Paddle early in the day for the calmest conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>River Currents:</strong> Even the gentle Bow River has currents. Know your skill level and choose appropriate sections. Never paddle alone on moving water.</p>
        <p><strong>Rental Bookings:</strong> Popular spots like Lake Louise and Moraine Lake can have long waits for canoe rentals. Arrive early or book guided tours in advance.</p>
        <p><strong>Leave No Trace:</strong> Pack out all garbage and respect shoreline vegetation. Stay off nesting areas and keep noise levels low to protect wildlife.</p>
