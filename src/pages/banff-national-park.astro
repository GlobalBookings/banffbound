        <h3>🏔️ First-Time Visitor Tips</h3>
        <p><strong>Allow Enough Time:</strong> Most visitors wish they had more time. Plan at least 3-5 days to see the highlights, a week or more to explore in depth.</p>
        <p><strong>Book Early:</strong> Accommodation, campgrounds, and shuttle reservations fill up months in advance for July-August. Start planning in January.</p>
        <p><strong>Layer Up:</strong> Mountain weather changes rapidly. Bring layers even in summer — temperatures can drop 15°C between valley floor and summit.</p>
        <p><strong>Gas &amp; Supplies:</strong> Fill up on gas in Canmore or Banff. There are limited services between Banff and Jasper on the Icefields Parkway.</p>
        <p><strong>Respect the Environment:</strong> Practice Leave No Trace principles. Take only photos, leave only footprints. This pristine wilderness depends on responsible visitors.</p>
