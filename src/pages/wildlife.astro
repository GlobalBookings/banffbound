    name: 'Moose',
    description: 'The largest member of the deer family, moose are solitary and elusive. They prefer marshy areas, willow thickets, and quiet waterways. A bull moose can stand over 2 metres tall at the shoulder and weigh up to 700 kg.',

            <h3>🚫 Never Feed Wildlife</h3>
            <p>Feeding wildlife is illegal in national parks. Human food habituates animals to people, which often leads to the animal being relocated or euthanized. A fed bear is a dead bear.</p>

        <h3>📸 Wildlife Photography Tips</h3>
        <p><strong>Golden Hours:</strong> The best wildlife photography happens in the first and last hour of daylight when animals are most active and the light is warmest.</p>
        <p><strong>Telephoto Lens:</strong> A 200-400mm lens is essential. Wildlife must be photographed from a safe distance — zoom in, don't walk in.</p>
        <p><strong>Patience Pays Off:</strong> Find a known wildlife corridor, set up quietly, and wait. Rushing through the park rarely yields the best sightings.</p>
        <p><strong>Know the Seasons:</strong> Fall elk rut (September), spring bear emergence (April-May), and winter wolf activity offer the most dramatic wildlife moments.</p>
        <p><strong>Respect the Wildlife:</strong> If an animal changes its behaviour because of your presence, you are too close. Back away slowly.</p>
