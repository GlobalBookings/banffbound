        <h3>⛷️ Ski Trip Planning Tips</h3>
        <p><strong>Season Dates:</strong> Ski season typically runs November through May. Sunshine Village has the longest season, often open until late May.</p>
        <p><strong>Shuttle Service:</strong> Free Roam Transit buses connect Banff to all three resorts. No car needed!</p>
        <p><strong>Altitude Awareness:</strong> Sunshine Village base is over 2,100 m. Drink plenty of water and take it easy on your first day to acclimatize.</p>
        <p><strong>Avalanche Safety:</strong> If venturing into the backcountry, carry a beacon, probe, and shovel, and have proper avalanche training.</p>
        <p><strong>Layering is Key:</strong> Temperatures can vary dramatically. Wear moisture-wicking base layers, an insulating mid layer, and a waterproof shell.</p>
        <p><strong>Parks Pass:</strong> You need a valid Parks Canada pass to drive through the national park to reach Sunshine Village and Lake Louise.</p>
