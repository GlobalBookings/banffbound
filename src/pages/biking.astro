        <h3>🚲 Biking Tips for Banff</h3>
        <p><strong>Helmet Required:</strong> Alberta law requires helmets for cyclists under 18, but we recommend helmets for all riders on mountain trails.</p>
        <p><strong>Wildlife Awareness:</strong> Make noise on trails to avoid surprising bears and other wildlife. Carry bear spray and know how to use it.</p>
        <p><strong>Trail Etiquette:</strong> Yield to hikers and horses. Stay on designated trails to protect fragile alpine ecosystems.</p>
        <p><strong>E-bike Rules:</strong> E-bikes are allowed on paved trails and roads but are prohibited on most singletrack trails in the national park.</p>
        <p><strong>Water & Sunscreen:</strong> The mountain sun is intense at altitude. Carry plenty of water and apply sunscreen frequently.</p>
