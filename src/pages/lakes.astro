        <h3>&#128161; Lake Visiting Tips</h3>
        <p><strong>Why are the lakes turquoise?</strong> Glaciers grind rock into fine "rock flour" that washes into the lakes. Sunlight reflecting off these suspended particles creates the vivid turquoise colour, most intense in July-August.</p>
        <p><strong>Arrive early:</strong> Popular lakes like Louise and Moraine fill their parking by 8-9am in summer. Start early or take transit/shuttles.</p>
        <p><strong>Bring layers:</strong> Lakeside temperatures are noticeably cooler than town. Expect wind, especially in the afternoon.</p>
        <p><strong>Pack out trash:</strong> Help keep these pristine lakes clean. Pack out everything you bring in.</p>
        <p><strong>Respect wildlife:</strong> Bears, elk, and other animals frequent lakeshores. Maintain safe distances at all times.</p>
