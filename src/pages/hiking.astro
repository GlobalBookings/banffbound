        <h3>🐻 Hiking Safety in Bear Country</h3>
        <p><strong>Carry Bear Spray:</strong> Always carry bear spray in an accessible holster (not in your pack). Know how to use it before you hit the trail.</p>
        <p><strong>Make Noise:</strong> Talk, clap, or sing on the trail, especially around blind corners and near streams where bears can't hear you approaching.</p>
        <p><strong>Hike in Groups:</strong> Groups of four or more are statistically much safer. Never hike alone in remote areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Trail Closures:</strong> Check Parks Canada's website for current trail conditions and closures due to bear activity.</p>
        <p><strong>What to Pack:</strong> Carry the 10 essentials — water, food, rain jacket, extra layers, sunscreen, first aid kit, headlamp, map, fire starter, and a whistle.</p>
        <p><strong>Start Early:</strong> Begin your hike early in the morning to avoid afternoon thunderstorms and to finish before dark.</p>
        <p><strong>Stay on Trail:</strong> Leaving marked trails damages fragile alpine vegetation that can take decades to recover.</p>
