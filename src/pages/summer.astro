        <div class="month-card">
          <h3>June</h3>
          <p>Trails are opening, wildflowers are starting, and the lakes are still thawing. Fewer crowds than July-August. Some high-elevation trails may have snow. Moraine Lake Road typically opens late May-early June.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="month-card">
          <h3>July</h3>
          <p>Peak season begins. All trails are clear, lakes reach maximum turquoise colour, and wildflower meadows are in full bloom. Book everything in advance. Start hiking before 7am to beat crowds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="month-card">
          <h3>August</h3>
          <p>Warmest month with the longest days. Crowds remain high but begin to thin by late August. Afternoon thunderstorms are common — carry rain gear. Wildlife is active at higher elevations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="month-card">
          <h3>September</h3>
          <p>The golden month. Larch trees turn brilliant gold in late September — Larch Valley above Moraine Lake is the top destination. Cooler mornings, fewer crowds, and shoulder-season pricing begins.</p>

        <h3>&#128161; Summer Survival Guide</h3>
        <p><strong>Beat the crowds:</strong> Arrive at popular trailheads and lakes before 8am. Visit mid-week instead of weekends. Book Moraine Lake shuttles as soon as they open (usually April).</p>
        <p><strong>Be bear aware:</strong> Carry bear spray on every hike and make noise on trails. Store food in bear-proof containers or your vehicle trunk. Never approach wildlife.</p>
        <p><strong>Layer up:</strong> Even in summer, temperatures vary widely. Morning starts can be 5°C while afternoons reach 25°C. Bring a rain layer for afternoon thunderstorms.</p>
        <p><strong>Sun protection:</strong> UV is intense at elevation. Wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat even on cloudy days.</p>
        <p><strong>Book early:</strong> Peak summer accommodation sells out months in advance. Reserve campgrounds, shuttles, and popular activities 3-6 months ahead.</p>
