  'best-time-to-visit-banff': `
<p>Banff National Park is stunning year-round, but each season offers a completely different experience. Knowing the best time to visit Banff depends on what you want to do, your budget, and how you feel about crowds.</p>

<h2>Summer (June to August)</h2>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> hiking, canoeing, scenic drives, wildlife viewing, and long daylight hours.</p>
<p>Summer is peak season in Banff and for good reason. The weather is warm (15-25°C), trails are clear of snow, and the lakes reach their peak turquoise colour by mid-July. This is when Moraine Lake and Lake Louise are at their most stunning.</p>
<p>The downside? Crowds. Expect packed parking lots, sold-out accommodations, and mandatory shuttle reservations for popular destinations like Moraine Lake. Book everything 3-6 months in advance.</p>
<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Start your days before 7am to beat the crowds at major attractions. Sunrise at Moraine Lake with no one around is worth the early alarm.</div>

<h2>Fall (September to October)</h2>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> larch season, photography, fewer crowds, and fall colours.</p>
<p>Late September brings larch season -- when alpine larch trees turn brilliant gold against the evergreen forests and blue mountain lakes. It's one of the most magical times to visit. The Larch Valley hike above Moraine Lake is the top destination for this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Shoulder season pricing kicks in, making accommodation 20-40% cheaper than summer. However, some facilities and shuttle services wind down by mid-October.</p>

<h2>Winter (November to March)</h2>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> skiing, snowboarding, ice walks, frozen waterfalls, hot springs, and northern lights.</p>
<p>Banff transforms into a winter wonderland with three world-class ski resorts. January and February offer the best powder conditions, though temperatures can drop to -20°C or colder. The frozen waterfalls at Johnston Canyon and ice skating on Lake Louise are quintessential winter experiences.</p>
<p>Winter accommodation prices are lower than summer (except holiday weeks), and the town has a cozy, magical atmosphere with far fewer tourists.</p>

<h2>Spring (April to May)</h2>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> budget travel, waterfalls at peak flow, and the transition from winter to summer.</p>
<p>Spring is the quiet shoulder season. Many hiking trails are still snow-covered until late May or June, but lower-elevation trails open up and waterfalls are thundering from snowmelt. It's the cheapest time to visit with the fewest crowds.</p>
<p>Be aware that Moraine Lake Road typically doesn't open until late May or early June, and some facilities may still be closed.</p>

<h2>Month-by-Month Quick Reference</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>January-February:</strong> Best skiing, frozen waterfalls, SnowDays festival, cold but magical</li>
<li><strong>March:</strong> Spring skiing begins, warmer days, still snowy</li>
<li><strong>April-May:</strong> Shoulder season, waterfalls peak, trails gradually opening</li>
<li><strong>June:</strong> Summer begins, trails opening, wildflowers starting, lakes still thawing</li>
<li><strong>July-August:</strong> Peak season, best weather, busiest crowds, all trails open</li>
<li><strong>September:</strong> Larch season, quieter, cooler mornings, stunning photography</li>
<li><strong>October:</strong> Late fall, snow begins, many facilities closing</li>
<li><strong>November-December:</strong> Ski season opens, holiday festivities, winter activities begin</li>

  'best-hikes-in-banff': `
<p>With over 1,600 km of maintained trails, Banff National Park is a hiker's paradise. Here are 15 of the best hikes sorted by difficulty, from easy lakeside strolls to challenging alpine adventures.</p>

<h2>Easy Hikes</h2>

<h3>1. Johnston Canyon to Lower Falls (1.1 km one way)</h3>
<p>The most popular hike in Banff, and for good reason. Walk along catwalks bolted to the canyon walls above the rushing creek to reach the stunning Lower Falls. Mostly paved and accessible, this is perfect for all ages and fitness levels.</p>

<h3>2. Bow Falls Trail (0.5 km)</h3>
<p>A short, easy walk from downtown Banff to one of the most photogenic waterfalls in the park. Combine it with the Bow River trail for a longer riverside stroll.</p>

<h3>3. Lake Louise Lakeshore (2 km one way)</h3>
<p>A flat, paved path along the shore of Lake Louise with stunning views of Victoria Glacier. Wheelchair accessible and stroller-friendly for most of the route.</p>

<h3>4. Tunnel Mountain (2.3 km one way)</h3>
<p>The shortest and easiest summit hike near Banff town. Switchbacks lead to 360-degree views of the Bow Valley, Mount Rundle, and the town below. Popular at sunrise and sunset.</p>

<h2>Moderate Hikes</h2>

<h3>5. Lake Agnes Tea House (3.4 km one way)</h3>
<p>Climb 400m in elevation from Lake Louise to a historic backcountry teahouse perched beside Lake Agnes. Enjoy fresh tea and scones with a mountain backdrop. One of the most rewarding moderate hikes in the Rockies.</p>

<h3>6. Johnston Canyon to Ink Pots (5.8 km one way)</h3>
<p>Continue past the Upper Falls to reach five cold mineral springs bubbling through vivid blue-green pools in an alpine meadow. Quieter than the canyon section and absolutely worth the extra effort.</p>

<h3>7. Sunshine Meadows (varies)</h3>
<p>Access via the Sunshine Village gondola in summer. Several interconnected trails wind through alpine meadows carpeted in wildflowers (mid-July to August), with views of the Continental Divide. Easy to moderate once you're up top.</p>

<h3>8. Plain of Six Glaciers (5.3 km one way)</h3>
<p>From the far end of Lake Louise, this trail leads through glacier-carved terrain to a teahouse with views of six glaciers. The final approach through the moraine offers dramatic scenery.</p>

<h2>Challenging Hikes</h2>

<h3>9. Sentinel Pass (5.8 km one way from Moraine Lake)</h3>
<p>The highest point reachable by maintained trail in the Canadian Rockies (2,611m). Steep switchbacks lead through Larch Valley (stunning in September) to a narrow pass between towering peaks. Extraordinary views in every direction.</p>

<h3>10. Cory Pass (5.8 km one way)</h3>
<p>A strenuous loop with 915m of elevation gain offering one of the best views in the park. The trail passes through a dramatic narrow canyon before reaching the pass overlooking Mount Louis.</p>

<h3>11. Cascade Amphitheatre (7.7 km one way)</h3>
<p>A rewarding climb to a massive natural amphitheatre carved into the side of Cascade Mountain. Wildflowers in summer, golden larches in fall. Relatively few crowds for such a spectacular payoff.</p>

<h3>12. Mount Temple Scramble (via Sentinel Pass)</h3>
<p>For experienced scramblers only. Mount Temple (3,544m) is the highest peak in the Lake Louise area. A full-day commitment with technical sections. Start before dawn and bring proper gear.</p>

<h2>Multi-Day & Backcountry</h2>

<h3>13. Skoki Loop (32 km loop, 2-3 days)</h3>
<p>A classic backcountry loop near Lake Louise passing through alpine meadows, past pristine lakes, and to the historic Skoki Lodge. One of the finest multi-day hikes in the Rockies.</p>

<h3>14. Egypt Lake via Healy Pass (12.4 km one way)</h3>
<p>A spectacular backcountry route over Healy Pass with views of the Massive Range, descending to the Egypt Lake area with its cluster of alpine lakes. Campground and shelter available.</p>

<h3>15. Sawback Trail (74 km, 4-5 days)</h3>
<p>A serious backcountry traverse connecting Banff to Lake Louise through the Sawback Range. Remote, challenging, and spectacularly beautiful. For experienced backpackers only.</p>

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Safety:</strong> Always carry bear spray and know how to use it. Check trail conditions at the Banff Visitor Centre before heading out. Register for backcountry permits if staying overnight. Tell someone your plans.</div>

  'lake-louise-complete-guide': `
<p>Lake Louise is the jewel of the Canadian Rockies -- a turquoise glacial lake framed by towering peaks and Victoria Glacier. Here's everything you need to know to plan a perfect visit.</p>

<h2>Getting There</h2>
<p>Lake Louise is 57 km (35 minutes) northwest of Banff town along the Trans-Canada Highway. You can drive, take Roam Transit Route 8X (seasonal), or join a guided tour. Parking fills up by 8-9am in summer, so arrive early or use transit.</p>

<h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
<p>The lake is accessible year-round, but the experience changes dramatically with the seasons. Summer (late June to September) offers the iconic turquoise water, canoeing, and hiking. Winter (December to March) brings ice skating on the frozen lake beneath the Chateau and incredible ice sculptures during the Ice Magic festival.</p>
<p>The lake reaches its most vivid turquoise colour in July and August when glacial melt carries fine rock flour into the water.</p>

<h2>Top Things to Do at Lake Louise</h2>
<h3>Walk the Lakeshore</h3>
<p>The 2 km flat path along the lake is the most popular activity. It's paved, accessible, and offers changing perspectives of the glacier and surrounding peaks.</p>

<h3>Canoe on the Lake</h3>
<p>Canoe rentals are available at the boathouse from June to September (approximately $135/hour for a two-person canoe). Paddling on the turquoise water with the glacier ahead is a bucket-list experience.</p>

<h3>Hike to Lake Agnes Tea House</h3>
<p>A 3.4 km moderate hike climbing 400m to a historic teahouse at 2,135m elevation. Fresh tea, baked goods, and stunning views of Lake Agnes. Budget 3-4 hours round trip.</p>

<h3>Hike the Plain of Six Glaciers</h3>
<p>A 5.3 km trail from the far end of Lake Louise leading to views of six glaciers and another backcountry teahouse. More challenging than Lake Agnes but less crowded.</p>

<h3>Winter Activities</h3>
<p>Ice skate on the frozen lake (skate rentals available), cross-country ski on groomed trails, or snowshoe through the surrounding forest. The Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise maintains the rink and provides warming areas.</p>

<h2>Dining</h2>
<p>The Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise has several restaurants ranging from casual to fine dining. For a unique experience, try the <strong>Afternoon Tea</strong> in the Lakeview Lounge. For budget options, pack a lunch -- there are limited alternatives beyond the Chateau.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Arrive before 8am in summer or after 4pm to avoid the worst crowds</li>
<li>The public parking lot is free but fills quickly. Overflow parking on the highway requires a shuttle</li>
<li>Bring layers -- the lakeside is noticeably cooler than Banff town</li>
<li>Restrooms are available at the Chateau and the trailhead area</li>
<li>A Parks Canada pass is required to enter Banff National Park</li>
</ul>

  'moraine-lake-guide': `
<p>Moraine Lake might be the most photographed lake in all of Canada. Its vivid blue water, the Valley of the Ten Peaks backdrop, and the dramatic rocky shoreline make it one of those places that genuinely lives up to the hype.</p>

<h2>How to Visit Moraine Lake in 2026</h2>
<p>Private vehicles are no longer permitted to drive to Moraine Lake during peak season (approximately June to mid-October). You must take the <strong>Parks Canada shuttle</strong> from the Lake Louise Park & Ride. Shuttle reservations open in spring and sell out quickly.</p>
<p>Book your shuttle at <a href="https://reservation.pc.gc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reservation.pc.gc.ca</a> as soon as reservations open (typically April). Morning slots are the most popular.</p>

<h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
<p>Moraine Lake Road typically opens in late May or early June, depending on snow conditions, and closes in mid-October. The lake is at its most vivid turquoise in July and August. For larch season, visit in late September when the alpine larch trees above the lake turn brilliant gold.</p>

<h2>Top Things to Do</h2>
<h3>The Rockpile Trail</h3>
<p>The short, easy climb up the rockpile at the lake's outlet gives you the famous viewpoint -- the one that was on the Canadian $20 bill. It takes about 15 minutes and is not to be missed.</p>

<h3>Canoe on the Lake</h3>
<p>Rent a canoe at the dock (approximately $135/hour) and paddle out onto the impossibly blue water. Early morning, before the wind picks up, is the best time.</p>

<h3>Hike to Sentinel Pass</h3>
<p>The trail from Moraine Lake climbs through Larch Valley to Sentinel Pass (2,611m), the highest maintained-trail point in the Canadian Rockies. The 11.6 km round trip is strenuous but incredibly rewarding.</p>

<h3>Consolation Lakes</h3>
<p>A moderate 3 km (one way) hike from Moraine Lake to a pair of alpine lakes beneath massive rock walls. Much quieter than the Larch Valley trail.</p>

<h2>Photography Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>The classic Rockpile viewpoint faces west -- morning light illuminates the peaks beautifully</li>
<li>Arrive on the first shuttle for the softest light and fewest people</li>
<li>Bring a polarizing filter to cut glare and enhance the water colour</li>
<li>The canoe dock area offers great reflections on calm mornings</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Important:</strong> Check the Parks Canada website for current road and shuttle status before your visit. Conditions can change quickly in the mountains.</div>

  'banff-in-winter': `
<p>Winter in Banff is pure magic. Snow-covered peaks, frozen waterfalls, world-class skiing, and a fraction of the summer crowds. If you're prepared for the cold, a winter trip to Banff might be even more memorable than summer.</p>

<h2>Skiing & Snowboarding</h2>
<p>Banff is home to three world-class ski resorts, collectively known as the <strong>SkiBig3</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunshine Village:</strong> Highest base elevation, longest season (November to late May), and the most natural snow. Over 3,300 acres of terrain.</li>
<li><strong>Lake Louise Ski Resort:</strong> The largest resort with 4,200 acres, stunning scenery, and terrain for all levels. Famous for its back bowls.</li>
<li><strong>Mt. Norquay:</strong> The closest to town (6 minutes), smallest of the three, but excellent for families and night skiing. Home to the Via Ferrata in summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>A SkiBig3 lift ticket gives you access to all three resorts. Multi-day passes offer significant savings.</p>

<h2>Johnston Canyon Ice Walk</h2>
<p>One of the most popular winter activities. Strap on ice cleats and walk along the frozen canyon to see the Lower and Upper Falls transformed into massive ice pillars. Guided tours are recommended as the trail can be icy and slippery.</p>

<h2>Ice Skating</h2>
<p>Skate on the frozen surface of <strong>Lake Louise</strong> with the Chateau and Victoria Glacier as your backdrop -- one of the most scenic skating experiences in the world. Rentals are available on-site. <strong>Vermilion Lakes</strong> and <strong>Two Jack Lake</strong> also freeze for skating in good conditions.</p>

<h2>Banff Upper Hot Springs</h2>
<p>There's nothing quite like soaking in naturally heated mineral pools (37-40°C) while snow falls around you and mountains tower overhead. Open year-round, but winter is when it's most atmospheric.</p>

<h2>Dog Sledding</h2>
<p>Mush through snowy wilderness with a team of Alaskan huskies. Several operators near Canmore and Lake Louise offer half-day and full-day tours through the backcountry.</p>

<h2>Northern Lights</h2>
<p>Banff's dark skies and northern latitude make it possible to see the aurora borealis on clear winter nights. Best viewing spots include Vermilion Lakes, Lake Minnewanka, and Two Jack Lake. Download an aurora forecast app and be ready to head out when activity spikes.</p>

<h2>What to Pack for Winter</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thermal base layers (merino wool recommended)</li>
<li>Insulated waterproof jacket and pants</li>
<li>Warm hat, gloves, and neck gaiter/balaclava</li>
<li>Insulated, waterproof winter boots with good grip</li>
<li>Hand and toe warmers</li>
<li>Sunglasses and sunscreen (the sun reflects intensely off snow)</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Temperature Warning:</strong> January and February temperatures can drop to -20°C to -30°C. Wind chill can make it feel even colder. Layer up, limit exposed skin, and take breaks indoors.</div>
`,

  'banff-in-summer': `
<p>Summer in Banff is peak season for a reason. Long daylight hours (sunrise before 6am, sunset after 10pm in June), warm temperatures, fully accessible trails, and turquoise lakes at their most vibrant. Here's everything you need to plan the perfect summer trip.</p>

<h2>Weather & What to Expect</h2>
<p>Summer temperatures range from 15-25°C (59-77°F) during the day, dropping to 5-10°C at night. Afternoon thunderstorms are common in July and August, so always carry a rain layer. The UV is intense at elevation -- sunscreen is essential.</p>

<h2>Top Summer Activities</h2>
<h3>Hiking</h3>
<p>All trails are typically snow-free by late June. The most popular hikes include Johnston Canyon, Lake Agnes Tea House, Sentinel Pass, and the Plain of Six Glaciers. Start early (before 7am) to beat crowds and afternoon storms.</p>

<h3>Canoeing & Kayaking</h3>
<p>Paddle the turquoise waters of Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, Emerald Lake, or the Bow River. Rental facilities operate at most major lakes from June to September.</p>

<h3>Scenic Drives</h3>
<p>The <strong>Icefields Parkway</strong> (Banff to Jasper) is widely considered one of the most beautiful drives in the world. The <strong>Bow Valley Parkway</strong> is a slower, more intimate alternative to Highway 1 with excellent wildlife viewing.</p>

<h3>White Water Rafting</h3>
<p>Ride the rapids on the Kicking Horse River (class III-IV) for thrills, or float the gentle Bow River for a family-friendly scenic experience. Multiple outfitters run daily trips.</p>

<h3>Wildlife Viewing</h3>
<p>Summer is prime time for wildlife. Elk graze on the edges of town, bears are active in alpine meadows, and bighorn sheep frequent the roadsides. Dawn and dusk are the best times for sightings.</p>

<h2>Beating the Summer Crowds</h2>
<ul>
<li>Arrive at popular trailheads and lakes before 8am</li>
<li>Visit mid-week instead of weekends</li>
<li>Book Moraine Lake shuttle reservations as soon as they open (usually April)</li>
<li>Explore lesser-known spots like Two Jack Lake, Herbert Lake, and Cascade Amphitheatre</li>
<li>Consider visiting in early June or September for shoulder season benefits</li>

<h2>Downtown Banff (Banff Avenue)</h2>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> walkability, restaurants, nightlife, and convenience.</p>

  'banff-food-guide': `
<p>Banff's food scene is far more impressive than you'd expect from a small mountain town. From farm-to-table fine dining to hearty pub grub and artisan bakeries, here's where to eat and drink in Banff.</p>

<h2>Fine Dining</h2>
<h3>The Bison Restaurant</h3>
<p>The crown jewel of Banff dining. Regional Rocky Mountain cuisine with locally sourced ingredients -- bison short ribs, elk carpaccio, Alberta beef, and an excellent wine list. The rustic-elegant Bear Street setting is perfect for a special night out. Reservations strongly recommended.</p>

  'icefields-parkway-guide': `
<p>The Icefields Parkway (Highway 93 North) is a 232 km road connecting Lake Louise to Jasper through the heart of the Canadian Rockies. It's regularly called one of the most scenic drives in the world, and it earns that title at every turn.</p>

<h2>Planning Your Drive</h2>
<p>The drive takes about 3 hours without stops, but you'll want a full day to properly enjoy it. Start from Lake Louise and drive north toward Jasper, or do it as a long day trip from Banff (returning the same way).</p>
<p>Gas up before you leave -- there's only one gas station on the entire route (Saskatchewan River Crossing, roughly the midpoint). Cell service is nonexistent for most of the drive.</p>

<h2>Must-Stop Viewpoints (South to North)</h2>

<h3>1. Herbert Lake</h3>
<p>Just 3 km from the Highway 1 junction. A calm lake with perfect mountain reflections, especially in early morning. Easy roadside stop.</p>

<h3>2. Bow Lake</h3>
<p>A stunning turquoise lake beneath Bow Glacier at km 36. Walk to the lakeshore for incredible reflections. The historic Num-Ti-Jah Lodge sits at its edge.</p>

<h3>3. Peyto Lake Viewpoint</h3>
<p>The most famous stop on the Parkway. A short walk from the parking area leads to a viewpoint overlooking a wolf-head-shaped lake in an impossible shade of blue. Arrive early -- the parking lot fills fast in summer.</p>

<h3>4. Mistaya Canyon</h3>
<p>A short 0.5 km walk to a narrow canyon where the Mistaya River has carved dramatic potholes and channels through the limestone. Easy and impressive.</p>

<h3>5. Saskatchewan River Crossing</h3>
<p>The only services on the route -- gas, food, and restrooms. Fill up here.</p>

<h3>6. Columbia Icefield & Glacier Skywalk</h3>
<p>The highlight of the drive. The Columbia Icefield is the largest icefield in the Canadian Rockies. You can walk to the toe of the Athabasca Glacier (free), take an Ice Explorer bus onto the glacier, or walk the glass-floored Glacier Skywalk suspended 280m above the valley.</p>

<h3>7. Tangle Falls</h3>
<p>A roadside waterfall that cascades right next to the highway. Easy photo stop with no hiking required.</p>

<h3>8. Sunwapta Falls</h3>
<p>A powerful waterfall where the Sunwapta River plunges through a narrow gorge. Short walk from the parking area.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Drive</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fill your gas tank before starting</li>
<li>Bring food and water -- services are minimal</li>
<li>Watch for wildlife on the road, especially at dawn and dusk</li>
<li>Check road conditions before departing (the road can close in winter due to avalanche risk)</li>
<li>A Parks Canada pass covers the entire route</li>
</ul>

  'banff-wildlife-guide': `
<p>Banff National Park is home to an extraordinary diversity of wildlife. From grizzly bears to tiny pikas, knowing where to look and how to stay safe enhances every visit.</p>

<h2>Common Wildlife in Banff</h2>

<h3>Elk</h3>
<p>The most frequently seen large animal in Banff. Elk often graze on the grassy areas around town, especially near the Banff Springs Golf Course and along the Bow River. They may appear calm but can be aggressive, particularly during the fall rut (September-October). Maintain at least 30 metres distance.</p>

<h3>Bighorn Sheep</h3>
<p>Often spotted along roadsides, especially on the highway near Lake Minnewanka and on the Icefields Parkway. They're accustomed to vehicles but should never be approached or fed.</p>

<h3>Black Bears</h3>
<p>Present throughout the park, though they tend to avoid heavily trafficked areas. Berry-rich areas in late summer are good spots. If you see one, stay at least 100 metres away and never approach.</p>

<h3>Grizzly Bears</h3>
<p>Less common than black bears but present in more remote areas. Grizzlies are larger, have a distinctive shoulder hump, and should be given even more space. Carry bear spray on all hikes.</p>

<h3>Mountain Goats</h3>
<p>Found at higher elevations. The Icefields Parkway, Sulphur Mountain summit, and Lake Louise area are good spots. Their white coats stand out against dark rock faces.</p>

<h3>Wolves & Coyotes</h3>
<p>Wolves are present but rarely seen. Coyotes are more common, sometimes spotted near roadsides and meadows at dawn and dusk.</p>

<h2>Best Wildlife Viewing Spots</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bow Valley Parkway:</strong> The single best road for wildlife in the park. Drive slowly (60 km/h speed limit) at dawn or dusk.</li>
<li><strong>Vermilion Lakes:</strong> Elk, ospreys, bald eagles, and occasionally bears.</li>
<li><strong>Lake Minnewanka:</strong> Bighorn sheep, deer, and bears along the lakeshore.</li>
<li><strong>Icefields Parkway:</strong> Mountain goats, bears, and bighorn sheep along the roadside.</li>
<li><strong>Fenland Trail:</strong> A short, easy loop near Banff town that's excellent for birdwatching and the occasional elk sighting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wildlife Safety Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maintain 100m distance from bears, wolves, and cougars; 30m from all other wildlife</li>
<li>Carry bear spray on every hike and know how to use it</li>
<li>Make noise on trails (talking, clapping) to alert bears of your presence</li>
<li>Never feed wildlife -- it's illegal and endangers both animals and people</li>
<li>Store food in bear-proof containers or your vehicle trunk</li>
<li>If you see a bear on or near a trail, stop, stay calm, back away slowly, and report the sighting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ski & Stay Packages</h2>
<p>Many Banff hotels offer ski & stay packages bundling accommodation with lift tickets at 20-30% savings compared to booking separately. Check the SkiBig3 website for current deals.</p>

<h2>Snow Conditions</h2>
<p>Banff's resorts receive 750-900 cm of snowfall annually. The best powder typically falls in January and February. Sunshine Village's high elevation and Continental Divide position give it the most consistent conditions.</p>

  'banff-photography-spots': `
<p>Banff National Park is one of the most photogenic places on Earth. Here are the 12 best photography locations, with tips on timing and composition.</p>

<h2>1. Moraine Lake Rockpile</h2>
<p>The classic Valley of the Ten Peaks viewpoint. Best at sunrise when warm light hits the peaks and the water is glassy calm. The angle from the top of the rockpile includes the iconic foreground rocks.</p>

<h2>2. Lake Louise at Sunrise</h2>
<p>Arrive before 7am for mirror reflections of Victoria Glacier. The best spot is the shoreline near the canoe dock. Morning light paints the glacier in warm tones.</p>

<h2>3. Peyto Lake Viewpoint</h2>
<p>The famous wolf-head-shaped turquoise lake viewed from above on the Icefields Parkway. Midday light works well here since the viewpoint faces north. A wide-angle lens is essential.</p>

<h2>4. Vermilion Lakes at Sunset</h2>
<p>Three lakes just minutes from Banff town offering spectacular sunset photography. Mount Rundle reflects beautifully in the calm water. The best shots are from the second lake.</p>

<h2>5. Two Jack Lake</h2>
<p>An underrated spot perfect for Milky Way photography on clear nights. The lakeside campsite with a canoe or picnic table makes a great foreground subject against Mount Rundle.</p>

<h2>6. Surprise Corner</h2>
<p>The classic viewpoint of the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel framed by the Bow River, Bow Falls, and mountain peaks. Morning light is best. A short walk from downtown.</p>

<h2>7. Bow Lake (Icefields Parkway)</h2>
<p>Crystal-clear turquoise water reflecting Crowfoot Mountain and Bow Glacier. The rocky shoreline provides natural leading lines. Best in morning light.</p>

<h2>8. Johnston Canyon Frozen Falls (Winter)</h2>
<p>Massive blue ice pillars and formations in winter. Long exposure photography of the frozen falls is dramatic. Bring a tripod and ice cleats.</p>

<h2>9. Larch Valley (September)</h2>
<p>When the alpine larch trees turn gold in late September, the contrast against blue sky and turquoise lakes is extraordinary. The hike starts from Moraine Lake.</p>

<h2>10. Banff Gondola Summit</h2>
<p>Panoramic views of the Bow Valley from 2,281m. Sunrise or sunset are best, though the gondola operating hours may limit options. The summit boardwalk offers multiple angles.</p>

<h2>11. Castle Mountain from the Bow Valley Parkway</h2>
<p>The dramatic flat-topped Castle Mountain is one of the most distinctive peaks in the Rockies. There are several pulloffs along Highway 1A with clear views. Sunset light is spectacular.</p>

<h2>12. Athabasca Glacier (Icefields Parkway)</h2>
<p>The massive glacier descending from the Columbia Icefield. Wide-angle shots from the toe of the glacier trail emphasize the scale. Overcast days can work well for even lighting on ice.</p>

<h2>General Photography Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bring a polarizing filter for water and sky shots</li>
<li>Shoot during golden hour (first/last hour of sunlight) for warmth and drama</li>
<li>Use a tripod for sunrise, sunset, night sky, and waterfall shots</li>
<li>Carry extra batteries -- cold temperatures drain them quickly</li>
<li>Check weather forecasts but don't shy away from clouds -- dramatic skies make dramatic photos</li>

  'rainy-day-banff': `
<p>Even in the mountains, rain happens. But a rainy day in Banff doesn't have to mean a wasted day. From world-class museums to cozy cafes, hot springs to bowling alleys, there are plenty of ways to enjoy Banff when the weather turns. Here are the best indoor activities and rainy day ideas.</p>

<h2>Hot Springs & Spas</h2>

<h3>Banff Upper Hot Springs</h3>
<p>Rain makes the hot springs even better. Soak in naturally heated mineral water (37-40°C) while rain patters around you and clouds swirl through the mountains above. It's atmospheric, relaxing, and you're getting wet anyway. Open daily year-round, adults $9.25.</p>

<h3>Fairmont Willow Stream Spa</h3>
<p>Treat yourself to a full spa day at the Fairmont Banff Springs. The Willow Stream Spa features an indoor mineral pool, waterfall, steam rooms, and an extensive menu of massages and treatments. Day access from $75.</p>

<h3>Kananaskis Nordic Spa</h3>
<p>Worth the 1-hour drive. The Nordic-inspired hydrotherapy circuit of hot pools, cold plunges, steam rooms, and saunas is designed to be enjoyed in any weather. Some say rain and mist make the outdoor pools even more magical. Book ahead — from $90.</p>

<h2>Museums & Cultural Sites</h2>

<h3>Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies</h3>
<p>Banff's premier museum tells the story of human life in the Canadian Rockies through art, photography, and artifacts. Rotating exhibits showcase mountain culture, Indigenous history, and contemporary art. A thoughtful way to spend 2-3 hours.</p>

<h3>Cave and Basin National Historic Site</h3>
<p>The birthplace of Canada's national park system. In 1883, three railway workers discovered natural hot springs in a cave here, leading to the creation of Banff National Park in 1885. Interactive exhibits, a restored cave, and the Discovery Walk make this a fascinating rainy-day visit.</p>

<h3>Banff Park Museum</h3>
<p>Canada's oldest natural history museum (opened 1903) housed in a beautiful log building on Banff Avenue. Taxidermy displays and exhibits on Rocky Mountain wildlife are surprisingly engaging. A National Historic Site and a quiet gem.</p>

<h2>Food & Drink Experiences</h2>

<h3>Park Distillery</h3>
<p>Tour a craft distillery that uses glacial water to make its spirits, then settle in for campfire-cooked food and creative cocktails. The cozy, dimly lit atmosphere is perfect for a rainy afternoon or evening.</p>

<h3>Wild Flour Bakery</h3>
<p>Grab a window seat with a sourdough croissant and coffee, and watch the rain fall on Banff Avenue. Their baked goods are some of the best in town.</p>

<h3>Banff Ave Brewing Co.</h3>
<p>Banff's original craft brewery. Sample a flight of house-brewed beers paired with solid pub food. The rooftop patio has a covered section if the rain eases up.</p>

<h2>Fun & Entertainment</h2>

<h3>High Rollers</h3>
<p>A bowling alley meets cocktail lounge on Banff Avenue. Roll a few frames while sipping craft cocktails — it's fun for couples, families, and groups alike. A great way to kill a few hours.</p>

<h3>Lux Cinema</h3>
<p>Catch a movie at the Lux Cinema in the heart of Banff. It's a small, charming theatre with new releases and a full concession stand.</p>

<h3>Shopping on Banff Avenue</h3>
<p>Browse the shops along Banff Avenue for outdoor gear, Canadian souvenirs, Indigenous art, and local crafts. The <strong>Banff Indian Trading Post</strong> has authentic Indigenous art and artifacts. Many shops have covered entries, making browsing pleasant even in rain.</p>

<h2>Low-Cloud Adventures</h2>
<p>If you don't mind getting a little wet, some activities are actually enhanced by moody weather:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Johnston Canyon:</strong> The canyon waterfalls are even more dramatic in the rain, and the covered catwalks provide some shelter</li>
<li><strong>Fenland Trail:</strong> A short forest loop where the tree canopy provides natural rain cover and the wet forest smells incredible</li>
<li><strong>Bow Falls:</strong> A quick walk from town — waterfalls in the rain are extra powerful</li>

</ul>

  'fall-larch-season-banff': `
<p>Every September, something magical happens in the Canadian Rockies. Alpine larch trees — one of the few conifers that shed their needles — turn brilliant gold against a backdrop of evergreen forests, turquoise lakes, and grey mountain peaks. Larch season in Banff is one of the most spectacular natural displays in North America, and this guide will help you experience it perfectly.</p>

<h2>What Are Larches?</h2>
<p>Alpine larches (<em>Larix lyallii</em>) are remarkable trees that grow at high elevations (2,000-2,400m) in the Canadian Rockies. Unlike most conifers, they are deciduous — their soft needles turn from green to vibrant gold each autumn before dropping. The contrast of golden larch groves against dark evergreens and blue mountain lakes creates some of the most stunning scenery in the Rockies.</p>

<h2>When Is Larch Season?</h2>
<p>Larch season typically peaks in the <strong>last week of September to the first week of October</strong>, though exact timing varies by year depending on temperatures. The colour change begins at higher elevations and moves downward over about 2-3 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early change (mid-September):</strong> Highest elevation larches begin to turn</li>
<li><strong>Peak colour (late September):</strong> Most larch groves are fully golden</li>
<li><strong>Late colour (early October):</strong> Needles begin dropping; lower-elevation larches may still be golden</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow Parks Canada social media and local hiking groups for real-time updates on larch conditions.</p>

<h2>Best Larch Hikes</h2>

<h3>1. Larch Valley & Sentinel Pass (from Moraine Lake)</h3>
<p>The most famous larch hike in the Rockies. The trail climbs from Moraine Lake through dense larch groves into Larch Valley, a high alpine meadow ringed with golden trees. Continue to Sentinel Pass (2,611m) for extraordinary views. Total: 11.6 km round trip, 725m elevation gain, strenuous.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Parks Canada requires groups of 4+ on this trail during larch season due to grizzly bear activity. The shuttle to Moraine Lake fills early — book well in advance.</p>

<h3>2. Lake Agnes & Big Beehive (from Lake Louise)</h3>
<p>Hike past the Lake Agnes Tea House to the Big Beehive for aerial views of Lake Louise and larch-dotted slopes. The trail passes through scattered larch groves, especially beautiful when the morning light filters through golden needles. Total: 10.5 km round trip, 520m elevation gain, moderate.</p>

<h3>3. Sunshine Meadows & Healy Pass</h3>
<p>Access via the Sunshine Village gondola (summer operation). The high-alpine meadows have scattered larch groves, and the Healy Pass trail offers panoramic views of golden larches against the Massive Range. Less crowded than Larch Valley. Total: varies by route, moderate.</p>

<h3>4. Taylor Lake & Panorama Meadows</h3>
<p>A quieter alternative that passes through beautiful larch forest near its high point. The meadows above Taylor Lake have larch groves and mountain views. Total: 12.6 km round trip, 600m elevation gain, moderate.</p>

<h3>5. Cascade Amphitheatre</h3>
<p>A rewarding hike to a massive natural amphitheatre with larch groves lining the upper elevations. Fewer crowds than Larch Valley and equally stunning golden colour. Total: 15.4 km round trip, 640m elevation gain, moderate-strenuous.</p>

<h2>Photography Tips for Larch Season</h2>
<ul>
<li>Morning light (7-10am) is warmest and most flattering for golden colours</li>
<li>Overcast days can be excellent — soft light saturates the gold tones without harsh shadows</li>
<li>Include turquoise lakes, grey peaks, or dark evergreens as contrast to the golden larches</li>
<li>Bring a telephoto lens to isolate individual larch trees against mountain backgrounds</li>
<li>Plan for rapidly changing weather — September conditions can shift from sunshine to snow in hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Book early:</strong> Moraine Lake shuttle reservations for late September sell out extremely fast</li>
<li><strong>Dress warm:</strong> Temperatures at larch elevation (2,000m+) can be near freezing, with wind chill</li>
<li><strong>Start early:</strong> Popular larch trails are extremely busy during peak season. Begin before 8am</li>
<li><strong>Carry bear spray:</strong> Bears are actively feeding before winter and frequent larch areas</li>
<li><strong>Have a backup plan:</strong> If Larch Valley trail is too crowded, Cascade Amphitheatre or Taylor Lake are excellent alternatives</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Consider joining a <a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/banff-l284/?partner_id=QW960HO" target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored">guided larch season hiking tour</a> — expert guides know the best groves, handle logistics, and ensure you meet the group-of-4 requirement for Larch Valley.</div>

  'bow-valley-parkway-guide': `
<p>The Bow Valley Parkway (Highway 1A) is one of the most beautiful and wildlife-rich roads in the Canadian Rockies. This 51 km route between Banff and Lake Louise winds through dense forest along the Bow River, offering a slower, more intimate alternative to the Trans-Canada Highway. If you see one road in Banff, it might be the Icefields Parkway — but if you want to see wildlife, this is the one.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The Bow Valley Parkway begins at the Highway 1/Highway 1A interchange just west of Banff town and ends at the Lake Louise junction, 51 km later. You can drive it in either direction. The speed limit is 60 km/h throughout — this is intentionally slow to protect wildlife and let you enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>Budget 2-3 hours for a leisurely drive with stops, or half a day if you hike Johnston Canyon.</p>

<h2>Best Stops (East to West)</h2>

<h3>1. Backswamp Viewpoint (km 2)</h3>
<p>A pulloff overlooking wetlands just minutes from the start. Excellent for birdwatching and elk sightings, especially at dawn and dusk. Bald eagles and ospreys are occasionally spotted here.</p>

<h3>2. Muleshoe Picnic Area (km 8)</h3>
<p>A scenic picnic spot along the Bow River. The Muleshoe viewpoint offers a sweeping valley panorama and is a reliable spot for wildlife sightings.</p>

<h3>3. Johnston Canyon (km 17)</h3>
<p>The most popular stop on the Parkway. Walk along catwalks bolted to the canyon walls to see the <strong>Lower Falls</strong> (1.1 km) and <strong>Upper Falls</strong> (2.7 km). For a longer adventure, continue to the <strong>Ink Pots</strong> (5.8 km) — five cold mineral springs bubbling through vivid blue-green pools. In winter, the frozen falls are spectacular on a guided ice walk.</p>

<h3>4. Moose Meadows (km 22)</h3>
<p>A marshy meadow area that's aptly named — moose are occasionally spotted here, along with elk and deer. Pull off carefully and scan the treeline, especially in early morning.</p>

<h3>5. Castle Mountain Viewpoint (km 28)</h3>
<p>A pulloff with a stunning view of Castle Mountain, one of the most dramatic and recognisable peaks in the Rockies. Its flat-topped, castle-like silhouette is especially photogenic in sunset light. Castle Junction, nearby, is a small hub with basic services.</p>

<h3>6. Castle Cliffs Viewpoint (km 33)</h3>
<p>Another angle on Castle Mountain and the surrounding cliffs. This stretch of road is lined with dense forest where black bears are frequently spotted in summer feeding on roadside berries.</p>

<h3>7. Protection Mountain Campground Area (km 38)</h3>
<p>The road winds through deep forest here with frequent wildlife sightings. Keep your eyes peeled and drive slowly — bears cross the road regularly in this section.</p>

<h3>8. Baker Creek (km 41)</h3>
<p>A small area with mountain lodge accommodation and trails into the backcountry. The Baker Creek area is quiet and scenic, with access to less-visited hiking routes.</p>

<h2>Wildlife on the Parkway</h2>
<p>The Bow Valley Parkway is the single best road in Banff for wildlife viewing. Species commonly spotted include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elk:</strong> Very common, especially in meadows at dawn and dusk</li>
<li><strong>Black bears:</strong> Frequently seen in summer, particularly in berry season (July-August)</li>
<li><strong>Grizzly bears:</strong> Less common but present — give them extra space (100m minimum)</li>
<li><strong>Deer:</strong> Mule deer and white-tailed deer are regular sightings</li>
<li><strong>Wolves:</strong> Occasionally spotted, especially in winter and early morning</li>
<li><strong>Coyotes:</strong> Common at dawn and dusk</li>
<li><strong>Bighorn sheep:</strong> Sometimes seen near Castle Mountain area</li>
</ul>

<h2>Seasonal Closures</h2>
<p>To protect wildlife during sensitive periods, Parks Canada implements seasonal closures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>March 1 to June 25:</strong> The eastern section (km 0-17, Banff to Johnston Canyon) is closed from 8pm to 8am daily to reduce disturbance during spring wildlife activity</li>
<li>The western section remains open year-round</li>
<li>Check the Parks Canada website for current closures before your visit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Driving the Parkway</h2>
<ul>
<li>Drive at dawn or dusk for the best wildlife sightings</li>
<li>Keep your speed at or below the 60 km/h limit</li>
<li>Pull completely off the road if you stop for wildlife — never block traffic</li>
<li>Keep 100m from bears and wolves, 30m from all other wildlife</li>
<li>Bring binoculars and a telephoto lens</li>
<li>Pack food and water — services are very limited along the route</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip-box"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For the best experience, drive the Parkway at sunset heading west, stopping at viewpoints as the light turns golden. Then return to Banff via the faster Highway 1.

  'banff-craft-beer-guide': `
<p>After a day of hiking, skiing, or exploring the mountains, nothing beats a cold craft beer. Banff's craft beer scene has grown significantly in recent years, with local breweries, taprooms, and beer bars serving up creative brews inspired by the mountain lifestyle. Here's your guide to the best pints in the Canadian Rockies.</p>

<h2>Breweries & Brewpubs</h2>

<h3>Banff Ave Brewing Co.</h3>
<p>Banff's original and most established craft brewery, located right on Banff Avenue. Their brewpub serves a rotating lineup of house-brewed beers alongside solid pub food. Must-try beers include the <strong>Head Smashed IPA</strong> (named after the nearby UNESCO World Heritage Site) and their seasonal specials. The rooftop patio is one of the best après-ski spots in town — order a flight of four and watch the sun set over the mountains.</p>

<h3>Grizzly Paw Brewing Company (Canmore)</h3>
<p>Just 20 minutes from Banff in neighbouring Canmore, Grizzly Paw is a must-visit for beer lovers. Their production brewery and taproom on Main Street offers tours, tastings, and a full restaurant menu. The <strong>Grumpy Bear Honey Wheat</strong> and <strong>Powder Hound Pilsner</strong> are local favourites. They also brew excellent small-batch and seasonal specialties.</p>

<h3>Banff Springs Brewing Company</h3>
<p>Located inside the Waldhaus Restaurant at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, this small brewery produces German-style beers in keeping with the restaurant's Bavarian theme. Enjoy a stein of house-brewed lager or hefeweizen with fondue and schnitzel in a cozy alpine setting.</p>

<h3>Three Bears Brewery & Restaurant (Canmore)</h3>
<p>A family-owned brewery and restaurant in Canmore with a warm, inviting atmosphere. Their beers range from approachable lagers to hop-forward IPAs. The wood-fired pizza is an excellent pairing. A more relaxed, locals-favourite vibe compared to Banff Ave.</p>

<h2>Best Beer Bars & Taprooms</h2>

<h3>The Rose & Crown</h3>
<p>A Banff institution — this British-style pub has been pouring pints for decades. While not a brewery, they have an excellent selection of craft beers on tap including local and regional favourites. The rooftop patio, live music, and lively atmosphere make it a top evening destination.</p>

<h3>Park Distillery</h3>
<p>While primarily a distillery (their spirits are made with glacial water), Park Distillery also serves a curated selection of craft beers alongside their famous campfire-cooked food and house cocktails. The atmosphere alone is worth the visit.</p>

<h3>High Rollers</h3>
<p>A bowling alley-cocktail lounge combo that also serves a good selection of local craft beers. Bowl a few frames while sampling mountain brews — it's a fun way to spend a rainy evening or après-ski session.</p>

<h2>Craft Beer Events</h2>
<p>Keep an eye out for these annual beer events in the Banff area:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banff Craft Beer Festival:</strong> Annual celebration featuring local and regional breweries, food pairings, and live music</li>
<li><strong>Canmore Uncorked:</strong> A food and drink festival that includes craft beer tastings alongside wine and spirits</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal tap takeovers:</strong> Local bars frequently host tap takeovers and meet-the-brewer events</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-Guided Brewery Trail</h2>
<p>Combine a Banff-Canmore brewery trail for a full day of tasting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start at <strong>Banff Ave Brewing Co.</strong> for a lunchtime flight and burger</li>
<li>Drive to <strong>Grizzly Paw Brewing</strong> in Canmore for a tour and tasting</li>
<li>Walk to <strong>Three Bears Brewery</strong> for afternoon pizza and beer</li>
<li>Return to Banff for evening drinks at <strong>The Rose & Crown</strong> rooftop</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: Designate a driver, take a taxi, or use Roam Transit between Banff and Canmore.</em></p>

  'banff-christmas-guide': `
<p>Christmas in Banff is pure mountain magic. Snow-covered peaks, twinkling lights along Banff Avenue, frozen lakes, and a cozy small-town atmosphere make this one of the most enchanting places in the world to celebrate the holiday season. Here's your complete guide to Christmas in the Canadian Rockies.</p>

<h2>Festive Events & Activities</h2>

<h3>Santa Claus Parade</h3>
<p>Banff's annual Santa Claus Parade kicks off the holiday season in late November. The parade winds along Banff Avenue with floats, marching bands, and of course Santa Claus himself. The town Christmas tree is lit during the ceremony, officially launching the festive season.</p>

<h3>Ice Magic Festival (Lake Louise)</h3>
<p>Held in January at the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, professional ice carvers from around the world create stunning sculptures on the frozen lakeshore. While technically after Christmas, booking a trip that spans both events is magical. Previous themes have included wildlife, fairy tales, and Canadian heritage.</p>

<h3>Christmas Markets</h3>
<p>The Banff Christmas Market (typically held in late November) features local artisan crafts, food vendors, hot chocolate, mulled wine, and live music. It's a wonderful way to find unique gifts and soak in the festive atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Holiday Skating at Lake Louise</h3>
<p>Ice skating on the frozen surface of Lake Louise with the illuminated Chateau as your backdrop is one of the most magical Christmas experiences in Canada. Skate rentals are available on-site, and the Chateau maintains the rink and provides warming areas.</p>

<h2>Christmas Dining</h2>

<h3>Holiday Dinner at the Fairmont Banff Springs</h3>
<p>The Castle in the Rockies goes all out for Christmas. Multiple restaurants offer special holiday menus, from elegant Christmas Eve dinners to festive Boxing Day brunches. The grand ballrooms and heritage hallways are decorated to perfection. Reservations are essential — book months in advance.</p>

<p>The ski season is in full swing by Christmas. <strong>Sunshine Village</strong>, <strong>Lake Louise Ski Resort</strong>, and <strong>Mt. Norquay</strong> are all open with excellent early-season conditions. The mountains are typically well-covered by late December, and the holiday week has a festive buzz on the slopes.</p>

<h3>Dog Sledding</h3>
<p>A dog sledding tour through snowy wilderness with a team of huskies is a quintessential Christmas-season activity. Half-day tours are available from several outfitters near Canmore and Lake Louise. Book a <a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/banff-l284/?partner_id=QW960HO" target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored">guided dog sledding experience</a> in advance.</p>

<h3>Johnston Canyon Ice Walk</h3>
<p>By Christmas, the canyon waterfalls are frozen into spectacular blue ice formations. Guided ice walks with crampons are one of the most popular winter activities in Banff.</p>

<h3>Banff Upper Hot Springs</h3>
<p>Soaking in the hot springs on a snowy Christmas evening is unforgettable. Steam rises against the dark sky while mountains tower above — bring the whole family for a post-Christmas-dinner tradition.</p>

<h2>Where to Stay for Christmas</h2>
<p>Christmas accommodation in Banff books up months in advance and rates are at winter peak levels. Book as early as possible.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Practical Tips</h2>
