        <h3>🏨 Accommodation Quick Tips</h3>
        <p><strong>Free Cancellation:</strong> Book refundable rates when possible — Banff weather can be unpredictable and plans change.</p>
        <p><strong>Parking:</strong> Many downtown hotels charge $15-$40/night for parking. Check before booking, especially if you have a vehicle.</p>
        <p><strong>Free Transit:</strong> Roam Transit connects Banff, Canmore, and Lake Louise. Staying outside downtown is viable with good bus service.</p>
        <p><strong>Kitchen Access:</strong> Dining in Banff is expensive. A room with a kitchenette can save significant money on meals.</p>
        <p><strong>Hot Tubs:</strong> After a long day of hiking or skiing, a hotel hot tub under the stars is a game-changer. Many Banff hotels have them.</p>
