        <h3>&#128161; Winter Survival Guide</h3>
        <p><strong>Dress in layers:</strong> Temperatures can drop to -20°C to -30°C in January and February. Wear thermal base layers (merino wool), an insulating mid-layer, and a waterproof outer shell.</p>
        <p><strong>Protect extremities:</strong> Insulated waterproof boots, thick gloves/mittens, a warm hat, and a neck gaiter or balaclava are essential. Hand and toe warmers are a lifesaver.</p>
        <p><strong>Winter driving:</strong> Winter tires or chains are legally required November-April on mountain highways. Drive slowly and check 511 Alberta for road conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Shorter days:</strong> December has only about 8 hours of daylight. Plan outdoor activities for midday and save indoor activities for morning and evening.</p>
        <p><strong>Budget perk:</strong> Winter accommodation (outside holiday weeks) is 20-40% cheaper than summer. Fewer crowds mean more relaxed experiences everywhere.</p>
